 <p class="block_information"> The 2001 BMW M3 appears worldwide with the new S54B32 engine. At the time of the car's appearance, this engine was the most productive "atmospheric engine" ever produced by the BMW company. It had a power of 343 hp. and a torque of 365 Nm. The first edition of the new M3 was painted in Laguna Seca Blue. The car came with the new SMG Drivelogic gearbox (SMG 2) and an F1-style electro-hydraulic manual shift system with no clutch pedal and paddle shifters under the steering wheel. The "red zone" started at 8,000 rpm, a first for BMW. The engine produced more than 100 hp. per liter of volume (343 hp/3.2 liters), the car accelerates to 100 km/h in 5.2 seconds, the maximum speed was 250 km/h (limited by electronics; without limiter - 286 km/h). 2 special versions were released: the M3 GTR V8 and the M3 CSL. M3 GTR was born in 2001. The machine is equipped with a 4-liter V-shaped 8-cylinder engine with a capacity of 350 hp. and four-wheel drive. The main reason for replacing the straight six is the impossibility of fighting on an equal footing with the Porsche 996 GT3. The M3 GTR V8 reached great heights at the American Le Mans, where it was fielded by the Schnitzer Motorsport team. In 2003, the limited series M3 CSL appears. The main differences of this machine were: a more powerful engine (360 hp), less weight (thanks to the carbon hood and roof). The car also underwent a number of cosmetic changes. Thus, the design of the wheel rims was changed, the rear spoiler was enlarged and a large air duct appeared on the front bumper.</p>
